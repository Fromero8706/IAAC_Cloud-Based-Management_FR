# lecture2

Examples for Lecture 2

These examples introduce html and javascript concepts we'll be using in the seminar. This session builds on [session 1](https://github.com/iaac-macad-s1/lecture1) and shows how to use JavaScript libraries.

- [Example 1](http://127.0.0.1:5502/Lecture2/example1/index.html):A sample that uses the [three.js](https://threejs.org) library
- [Example 2](http://127.0.0.1:5502/Lecture2/example2/index.html): A sample that uses the [rhino3dm](https://www.rhino3d.com/features/rhino3dm/) library
- [Example 3](http://127.0.0.1:5502/Lecture2/example3/index.html): A sample that creates Rhino objects with the rhino3dm library and visualizes them with three.js
- [Example 4](http://127.0.0.1:5502/Lecture2/example4/index.html): Adding new Rhino Geometry
- [FR -  Assignment 2](http://127.0.0.1:5502/Lecture2/Assignment/index.html) : Combines two excercises into a single HTML file.


# lecture3

These examples introduce how to use RhinoCompute as a remote geometry calculation service.
